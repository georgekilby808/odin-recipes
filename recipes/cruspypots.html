<h1>Cruspy Pots, Baby!</h1>
<img src="../images/cruspypots.jpg" height="500" width="500" alt="Once again, this really isn't what the recipe looks like, but I'm too lazy to add my own photos.">
<p>I started making this based off a tiktok.</p>
<p>It is a <em>very</em> OK lunch option because you can make a bunch and eat it for a few days and the macros are quite friendly.</p>
<p>I call it Cruspy Pots because I misspelled it the first time I was recording it and I enjoy how it looks.</p>

    <li>~1kg baby potatoes</li>
