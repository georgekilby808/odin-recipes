<h1>Cruspy Pots, Baby!</h1>
<img src="../images/cruspypots.jpg" height="500" width="500" alt="Once again, this really isn't what the recipe looks like, but I'm too lazy to add my own photos.">
<p>I started making this based off a tiktok.</p>
<p>It is a <em>very</em> OK lunch option because you can make a bunch and eat it for a few days and the macros are quite friendly.</p>
<p>I call it Cruspy Pots because I misspelled it the first time I was recording it and I enjoy how it looks.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>~1kg baby potatoes</li>
    <li>light soft cheese</li>
    <li>lemon juice</li>
    <li>Chicken, tuna, or your preferred protein (or none)</li>
    <li>1 red onion</li>
    <li>~ half a cucumber</li>
    <li>seasoning for the potatoes - I like to use:<ol><li>rosemary</li><li>garlic</li><li>sometimes za'tar or harissa</li><li>there's really no wrong answers</li></ol></li>
    <li>parsley</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>

<ol>
    <li>We start by halving and parboiling the baby potatoes. Make sure you have a decent few inches of water above your potatoes and a good lick of salt in the water. I tend to parboil for about 15-20 minutes but the fork-tenderness is the true test.</li>
    <li>When the potatoes are parboiled, drain the water. I like to let them rest and release steam for a little while. When you feel equal to the task, lay them on a baking sheet so that the cut side faces down. You might want to start preheating the oven at this point.</li>
    <li>Now for the fun part! Take a fork or a heavy bottom glass and squish the potatoes down. You don't want to kill them, but we want ideally for them to be about 1-2cm thick on the baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Now apply the oil and the seasoning of your choice. There's a few options you can go for here - at the moment I like to spread the seasoning on and then spray olive oil over the whole thing, but there's really no wrong answers here. In terms of amounts, more olive oil will get you nicer, crisipier potatoes, but I am calorie counting, so I shoot for about a tablespoon per kilo of potatoes - this doesn't get your super crispy potatoes but it's good enough for me.</li>
    <li>Bake the potatoes for about 20-30 minutes. There's not a perfect time here, you want to give it 20 minutes, check it, move some stuff around, keep checking etc. I feel like an air fryer would work better than an oven but literally who cares.</li>
    <li>When the potatoes are cooked, you ideally want to let them cool somewhere. A wire rack is great, a big bowl works, even a plate if you don't mind washing it. <em>(I sometimes don't bother doing this too hard. It's fine if you can't be bothered).</em></li>
    <li>Now we need to prep the rest of the dry ingredients. I tend to do this on one big chopping board with a mixing bowl in front of me. Dice the onion and the cucumber up fine. The protein, follow your heart, you know what you like. Throw it all in a bowl with the potatoes. give it a mix. Sometimes I chop the cooked potatoes up a bit too. I would suggest adding the parsley last and <em>really</em> slicing it up finely.</li>
    <li>The dressing is pretty simple. We're taking the light soft cheese and thinning it out. I like lemon juice for this but water or milk works fine. Put a decent sized dollop (100g or so) of light soft cheese into a small bowl. Add about half the volume again of lemon juice. Whisk it together, with a fork if you don't have a whisk. But also, you should have a whisk. See how you feel about the consistency and amount and add more of either ingredient as you prefer.</li>
    <li>Stick the dressing into the mixing bowl with the dry ingredients. Mix it all together. Portion it. That's it, you're done.</li>
