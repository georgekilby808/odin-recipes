<p>Gyros. You know them as overpriced street food you buy from a stall in the UK and wonder, is it actually what they eat in Greece?</p>
<p>But they're actually pretty easy to make yourself, as long as you buy most of the stuff already made.</p>
<p>So skip past this description, and get ready to read the recipe.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Flatbreads (you can usually find them at Tesco).</li>
    <li>1 Chicken breast per person (or your meat of choice)</li>
    <li>Tzatziki (I buy mine readymade)</li>
    <li>Tomato (Beef preferred)</li>
    <li>Red Onion</li>
    <li>Chips (or fries).</li>
    <li>Garlic, white wine, rosemary, salt, lemon juice, olive oil, oregano (for the marinade).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>First, you want to dice or cube and then marinade your chicken. Let it sit for at least 10 minutes in the marinade, and then cook it - any method works. Usually I put the chips on at the same time.</li>
    <li>Now you want to prep the tomatoes and the onion. I like to cut the tomatoes first, give the chopping board a quick wipe, then then the onion. The key for both is that we're looking for thin slices. We're not making cubes - unless you want to - we're making thin strips. Place these in bowls.</li>
    <li>At this point, most of the real work, such as it is, is done. Decant or open your tzatziki.</li>
    <li>Make sure you have your tomato, tzatziki and red onion plated and ready to go.</li>
    <li>When the chicken is nearly done, you want to warm a flatbread per person. You can do this in the oven or the microwave; I don't give a shit.</li>
    <li>Let the chicken finish. Douse your chips in paprika. Spread some tzatziki on your flatbread. Put everything that isn't the flatbread on the flatbread and curl it over. </li>
    <li>Eat.</li>

</ol>
