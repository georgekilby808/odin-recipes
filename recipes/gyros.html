<p>Gyros. You know them as overpriced street food you buy from a stall in the UK and wonder, is it actually what they eat in Greece?</p>
<p>But they're actually pretty easy to make yourself, as long as you buy most of the stuff already made.</p>
<p>So skip past this description, and get ready to read the recipe.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Flatbreads (you can usually find them at Tesco).</li>
    <li>Chicken(or your meat of choice)</li>
    <li>Tzatziki (I buy mine readymade)</li>
    <li>Tomato (Beef preferred)</li>
    <li>Red Onion</li>
    <li>Chips (or fries).</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
